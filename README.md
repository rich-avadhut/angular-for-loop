# angular-for-loop

Here is the example of Switch-Case in angular.

1. Create an array & object in the app.componenet.ts file.
Here variable `indoorGames` is an array & variable `outdoorGames` as an object

   `this.indoorGames = ["Snooker","Squash","Bowling","Table Tennis","Badminton","Chess","Carem"];`
    
    `this.outdoorGames = [`
      `{`
        `"id": 1,`
        `"name": "Basketball"`
      `},`
      `{`
        `"id": 2,`
        `"name": "Volleyball"`
      `},`
      `{`
        `"id": 3,`
        `"name": "Frisbee"`
      `},`
      `{`
        `"id": 4,`
        `"name": "Golf"`
      `},`
      `{`
        `"id": 5,`
        `"name": "Soccer"`
      `},`
      `{`
        `"id": 6,`
        `"name": "Cricket"`
      `}`
    `]; `

2. Write the for loops code for both the indoor game and outdoor games, as per code is written in the file app.component.html

3. Add Bootstrap CSS into index.html

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">`

4. Run the Application using

`ng serve -o`
